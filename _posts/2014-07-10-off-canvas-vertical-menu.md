[Live demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43065769/Dev/VerticalMenuPage/index.html "Online demo") / [code](https://github.com/lmaran/VerticalMenuPage/)

Based on an idea stolen from [StartBootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/simple-sidebar).

## Features

All original features were preserved:

- off canvas, full height, vertical menu
- responsive design
- IE9+

...and also added:

- expand/collapse buttons
- auto-collapse menu for 'small' screens (when click a link in menu)
- no horizontal scrollbar when the menu is manually expanded
- sticky header

All in pure HTML, CSS, JS (no JQuery dependency).

A remark:
For simplicyty, I've putted together all parts (HTML, CSS, JS) in the `index.html` file so that you can access them via 'View Source' in [live demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43065769/Dev/VerticalMenuPage/index.html "Online demo").
